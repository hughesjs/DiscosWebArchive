The debris are all quite small with the largest exhibiting a radar crosssection of about 0.02 m2, roughly equivalent to 15 cm in diameter. Two other spacecraft in the Meteor 2 series have been linked to anomalous fragmentation events, including Meteor 2-17, for which 30 debris have been cataloged to date. Meteors 2-5, 2-6, and 2-7 have also released cataloged debris ranging from 8 to 19 in number. All of the Meteor 2 events have occurred many years after launch and are possibly due to a degradation of the vehicle itself.","eventType":"Meteor Class","objects":[{"cosparId":"1982-025A","vimpelId":null,"satno":13113,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":1500,"length":1.4,"height":4.5,"depth":4.5,"xSectMax":6.48534440231986,"xSectMin":1.539380400259,"xSectAvg":5.71769862953342,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Meteor 2-8","id":"13110"}],"name":"","id":"183"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1981-04-15T00:00:00","comment":"Second event observed in August 1986.

The BLITS is a completely inert object consisting of a glass sphere encased in another glass sphere with a total mass of 7.53 kg and a full diameter of 17 cm (see figure). The internal sphere contains a retro-reflector, which serves as a target for laser ranging stations to obtain very precise altitude measurements. The satellite was reported to be spinning at a rate of 5.6 seconds prior to the suspected collision and at a rate of only 2.1 seconds afterwards. The force of the collision reduced the orbital period of BLITS by less than 0.004 minutes. Very soon thereafter, the U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) detected a new object in a similar orbit, but with an orbital period slightly greater (~0.006 min) than the original period of BLITS. This object, with an estimated size of 10 cm, was later cataloged with an International Designator of 2009-049J and a U.S. Satellite Number of 39119.

For the next two years, UARS (International Designator 1991-063B, U.S. Satellite Number 21701) gradually lost altitude, coming closer to its eventual fiery reentry (Figure 1).

Two debris (U.S. Satellite Numbers 32291 and 32292) were thrown in a retrograde direction, while the other two debris (U.S. Satellite Numbers 32297 and 32298) were sent on posigrade trajectories. One fragment was found in an orbit with a period more than one minute less than that of UARS, whereas the period of another fragment gained two minutes. Initially, a few other debris were thought to have been detected by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network, but they could not be found with follow-up observations. The two lower orbital debris fell back to Earth by the end of November, leaving only two debris remaining in orbit at the end of the year. The cause of UARS\u0027 minor fragmentation is still under investigation. The spacecraft had been purged of all propellants and its batteries had been left in a safed state. Only a slight amount of pressurant is judged to have been a potential energy source at the time of the event.

According to Russian reports, the nuclear reactors on Cosmos 1818 and Cosmos 1867 functioned for approximately 5 and 11 months, respectively. For the next two decades, the two inactive spacecraft circled the Earth without significant incident. Following the fragmentation event on or about 4 July 2008, the U.S. Space Surveillance Network was able to produce orbital data on 30 small debris (Figure 2). The majority of these debris were ejected in a posigrade direction with velocities of less than 15 meters per second, suggesting a relatively low energy event. From radar detections, a larger number of very small debris appear to have also been released, but routine tracking of these debris has proven difficult. Special observations of a few of the debris revealed characteristics generally indicative of metallic spheres. Cosmos 1818 employed sodiumpotassium (NaK) as a coolant for its reactor, as did the older RORSATs. Much of the NaK within Cosmos 1818 probably was in a solid state at the time of the debris generation event. However, some NaK present in the radiator coolant tubes might have reached a temporary liquid state, particularly when the spacecraft was exposed to direct solar illumination. A breach in a coolant tube (for example, due to long-term thermal stress) at such a time could have resulted in the release of NaK droplets. Alternatively, the hyper-velocity impact of a small particle might have generated sufficient heat to melt some of the NaK, which then would have formed spheres with metallic properties.","eventType":"TOPAZ Leakage Class","objects":[{"cosparId":"1987-011A","vimpelId":null,"satno":17369,"shape":"Cyl","mass":1250,"length":1.3,"height":9.3,"depth":9.3,"xSectMax":12.1626430544772,"xSectMin":1.32732289614169,"xSectAvg":10.159125243546,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-1818 (NPP)","id":"17366"}],"name":"","id":"223"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2002-12-24T00:00:00","comment":"The fragment is catalogued object 27637","eventType":"Anomalous","objects":[{"cosparId":"1978-064A","vimpelId":null,"satno":10967,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 4 Pan","mass":2279.48,"length":1.5,"height":20.98,"depth":20.98,"xSectMax":31.5195765282075,"xSectMin":1.76714586764426,"xSectAvg":25.6000531359398,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Seasat 1","id":"10965"}],"name":"","id":"347"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2014-11-30T00:00:00","comment":"On 30th November 2014, the spacecraft produced four pieces of debris that are currently tracked and catalogued by JSpOC.

The spacecraft had been on-orbit 4.4 years and was in a 97.6 deg inclination, 543 by 539 km orbit at the time of the event. Over 12 fragments were observed initially by the SSN. However, as of 8 November, only one piece (SSN 41797) had entered the catalog, having decayed from orbit on 12 October 2016; the remainder have decayed as well. At the current time, this event is categorized as an anomalous separation of multiple high area-to-mass ratio debris.

It had a repeating ground track every 95 revolutions. It maintained this tightly controlled orbit until mid-April 1988. On 10 April the last orbit correction occurred. After that a steady decay started. Initially it was thought that the spacecraft would descend to the 89.6 minute orbit with a 7-day, 111 revolution, repeating pattern. That altitude was reached on 9 May 1988 and when the spacecraft continued to drop it was obvious that the spacecraft was in trouble. TASS announced on 13 May 1988 that contact with the craft was lost in April, but that there was no danger to the general public because there were \\\u0022systems ensuring radiation safety on completion of the flight\\\u0022. Meanwhile, Kosmos-1932 terminated its mission and safely boosted its reactor to the high orbit, using a back-up system: all through the natural decay of the craft its attitude control seems to have been working well. But then the spacecraft lost stabilization - due to aerodynamic forces or loss of attitude control propellant. Also, electric power must have been generated throughout this long period - and the only available source of power was the reactor. It must have performed reasonably well since it did not trigger the ascent to high orbit. But the loss of attitude control immediately triggered the boost to higher orbit - at 21:08 UT on 30 September 1988, according to TASS. However, the resulting high orbit was somewhat different from normal, possibly caused by an incorrect initial attitude at separation of the ascent vehicle. If the maneuver started at the equator the yaw error could have been as much as 45 degrees causing a lower apogee of the transfer orbit. The final orbit was about 300 km lower than normal; actually between 695.4 km and 763.4 km at 66.1 degree inclination.","eventType":"RORSAT Reactor Core Ejection Class","objects":[{"cosparId":"1987-101A","vimpelId":null,"satno":18665,"shape":"Cone \u002B Cyl","mass":1200,"length":1.3,"height":5.8,"depth":5.8,"xSectMax":7.65593796151863,"xSectMin":1.32732289614169,"xSectAvg":6.5855636000876,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-1900 (NPP)","id":"18662"}],"name":"","id":"575"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1982-11-10T00:00:00","comment":"When Kosmos-1365 was deactivated on 27 September, a replacement for that satellite was promptly launched with Kosmos-1412  (Satno 13600, Int. designator 1982-099A) at 00:00 UT on 2 October 1982.

The first fragmentation event occurred nine years after launch and resulted in 11 new cataloged objects. The second event was detected by D.G. King-Hele of the RAE, and NAVSPASUR confirmed 44 additional fragments. By August 1976 no additional debris had been cataloged but 19 objects were being tracked in orbits with mean motions near 8 and eccentricities between 0.16 and 0.34. Due to the character of PAGEOS and its subsequent debris, natural perturbations had little effect on orbital period but strongly increased eccentricity by simultaneously lowering perigee and raising apogee. About 10 September 1976 one of the 19 unofficial objects is believed to have broken up into perhaps more than 250 new pieces, none of which were cataloged prior to reentry. Eighteen objects were later cataloged during 7-8 October 1976. On the first anniversary of the second fragmentation (20 Jan 1977), 45 fragments were cataloged without elements and immediately decayed administratively. Additional fragmentations are suspected to have taken place in June 1978, September 1984, and December 1985. Historically, radar tracking of PAGEOS debris has been extremely difficult and cross-tagging frequent. Cause for the second and subsequent events may be material deterioration under environmental stress.

Fortunately, all the debris were left in short-lived orbits with twothirds already having reentered the atmosphere by the beginning of September. Under a commercial contract, Russia launched the Asiasat 5 spacecraft on 11 August 2009, employing a powerful Proton-M launch vehicle equipped with a Breeze-M (aka Briz-M) final stage. This stage is designed to carry a geosynchronous spacecraft from a low altitude parking orbit into a highly elliptical transfer orbit with two burns. The first burn raises the apogee altitude to nearly 36,000 km, followed by a second burn which typically raises perigee several thousand kilometers or more. Before the second burn is initiated, a large (1.3 metric ton dry mass) propellant tank is ejected. For the Asiasat 5 mission, the Breeze-M tank (International Designator 2009-042C, U.S. Satellite Number 35698) was left in an orbit of 400 km by 35,740 km with an inclination of 49.2 degrees. Over the next 10 months, the tank\\u2019s orbit gradually decayed until by late 21 June 2010, the orbit had fallen to about 95 km by 1500 km with reentry expected within several hours. However, about 15 minutes after passing through perigee at 2145 GMT, the stage fragmented into a large number of pieces. By mid-September, a total of 85 debris had been officially cataloged by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network. Such fragmentations are not uncommon for objects decaying rapidly from highly elliptical orbits with perigees below 100 km. Normally, though, the fragmentations appear to occur near perigee (the point of highest stress), which leads to debris reentry within hours or, at most, days. In the case of this Breeze-M propellant tank, the object had climbed to an altitude of nearly 500 km before the breakup event.","eventType":"Aerodynamics","objects":[{"cosparId":"2009-042C","vimpelId":null,"satno":35698,"shape":"Torus","mass":1000,"length":2.1,"height":4,"depth":4,"xSectMax":12.5663706143592,"xSectMin":7.45360590058275,"xSectAvg":8.21789806830189,"objectClass":"Rocket Mission Related Object","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Briz-M auxiliary tank (DTB)","id":"35695"}],"name":"","id":"185"},{"altitude":36511,"latitude":0.2,"longitude":88.8,"epoch":"1996-02-19T00:00:00","comment":"The first burn of this stage was successful and indicates that 23797 was in a transfer orbit.

Although at least two detectable debris were generated, the spacecraft continues to this day to provide valuable data on the topography of the Earths oceans.Following a launch from Vandenberg AFB in California by a Delta 2 rocket on 7 December 2001, Jason-1 (International Designator 2001-055A, U.S. Satellite Number 26997) quickly reached its operational orbit of 1336 km with an inclination of 66 degrees, where it coordinated operations with the earlier U.S.-French spacecraft TOPEX/Poseidon. However, on 16 March 2002, spacecraft controllers noted a distinct attitude upset of the vehicle. A detailed study of the spacecraft\\u00e2s perturbations suggested that a small particle had struck the left solar array from above on the segment closest to the main structure. The attitude upset was accompanied by a temporary (a few hours) electrical current disturbance. Although not linked, at the time, to the spacecraft anomaly, the U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) soon detected two new objects in orbits slightly lower than that of Jason-1. The debris were determined to have been ejected from the spacecraft with moderate velocities of 24 and 46 meters per second, respectively. Both debris are also small (less than 20 cm) and exhibit relatively large area-tomass ratios (\u003E 2 m2/kg). Subsequent orbital analyses by SSN specialists indicated that the debris indeed originated from Jason-1 on 16 March 2002, although the objects were not officially cataloged until 2009 and 2011 as Satellite Numbers 35414 and 37379. It is not possible to discern whether the impacting particle was natural or manmade. At the altitude of Jason-1, the orbital debris population is relatively slight. Jason-1 experienced a second anomaly (including temporary loss of command) in 2005, but there is no evidence that the event was caused by a particle impact.","eventType":"Small Impactor","objects":[{"cosparId":"2001-055A","vimpelId":null,"satno":26997,"shape":"Box \u002B 2 Pan","mass":500,"length":3.3,"height":1.9,"depth":6,"xSectMax":15.8060222536391,"xSectMin":3.61,"xSectAvg":10.1761333333333,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Jason","id":"26994"}],"name":"","id":"192"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2007-07-25T00:00:00","comment":"On 25 July, the second stage of the Japanese H-2A rocket body (International Designator 2006-037B, U.S. Satellite Number 29394), which placed the IGS-3A spacecraft into orbit in September 2006, experienced a second debris generation event.

The event, which occurred at an altitude of approximately 1370 km, was sufficient to alter the orbit of the spacecraft and to produce a new piece of debris which was large enough to be tracked. Radar returns suggest the fragment diameter was between 20 and 50 cm. Analysts of Air Force Space Command, noticed a new object in the vicinity of Cosmos 539 (1972-102A, U.S. Satellite Number 6319) and calculated that the fragment was ejected from the spacecraft on 21 April at a relative velocity of 19 m/s. The newly created debris was cataloged as U.S. Satellite Number 27423 on 6 May. The causes of these debris-producing events are thought to be related to the degradation of satellite surface materials under the harsh temperature and radiation environment of outer space and to sub-millimeter particle impacts. Also immediately obvious was the high susceptibility of the fragment to solar radiation pressure, demonstrated by rapid and dramatic changes in its orbit. From an initial orbit of about 1365 km by 1445 km with an inclination of 74 degrees, the fragment\\u00e2s perigee began to decrease while its apogee increased. Within four weeks the orbit had been perturbed into one of 750 km by 1895 km. At this point, atmospheric drag became the dominant factor, causing the object to reenter the atmosphere a little more than two weeks later on 3 June. Thus, the fragment existed for only 43 days. At the time of the event the spacecraft was in an orbit of approximately 1340 km by 1380 km. Satellite tracking data indicated that a small but permanent change in the orbit of Cosmos 539 coincided with the creation of the piece of debris. Such an orbital perturbation would be a natural result of a collision with a small object. The orbital period of the spacecraft was reduced by nearly a second.

The previous flight had taken place in November 2006 and had resulted in the unplanned release of more than 60 debris shortly after orbital injection of the second stage (ODQN, January 2007, p. 2). Due to their release altitude near 850 km, only five of the debris had fallen out of orbit a year later. Despite an intense investigative effort, the source of the debris, which did not affect the subsequent workings of the stage, could not be identified with high confidence. Hence, the flight of USA 197 on 11 November 2007 was of particular interest to space surveillance and orbital debris specialists. This latest flight of the Delta IV launch vehicle called for the second stage to achieve three distinct orbits: a low-Earth parking orbit, a geosynchronous transfer orbit, and a nearly geosynchronous payload delivery orbit. Like its predecessor, this second stage (International Designator 2007-054B, U.S. Satellite Number 32288) also produced large (\u003E10 cm) debris after entering Earth orbit. At least two dozen debris appear to have been released after the stage reached its temporary parking orbit, which was reported to be approximately 220 km by 1575 km (Figure 2). Also, like the 2006 mission, the debris released had no apparent detrimental effect on the performance of the stage which successfully carried its payload to the planned destination orbit.

Special ground-based observations confirmed that a much greater number of smaller debris was also generated in the unprecedented event. Iridium 33, a U.S. operational communications satellite and Cosmos 2251, a Russian decommissioned communications satellite , collided at 1656 GMT as the two vehicles passed over extreme northern Siberia at an altitude of 790 km. Both spacecraft were in nearly circular orbits with high inclinations: 86.4 degrees and 74.0 degrees, respectively. At the time of the collision, the two orbital planes intersected at a nearly right angle, resulting in a collision velocity of more than 11 km/s. The two complex spacecraft were of moderate dry mass: 560 kg for Iridium 33 and approximately 900 kg for Cosmos 2251. Although the number of debris tracked by the SSN is high, an even larger amount (~1300) would be expected if the two satellites had hit body-to-body. Due to the differential orbital periods of the debris, their orbital planes will gradually separate and form a shell about the Earth. The debris from the Iridium 33 spacecraft will spread more slowly than those from Cosmos 2251 due to their higher inclination. The Haystack and the Haystack Auxiliary radars observations confirmed a large number of small debris from both spacecraft. The collision of Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 occurred in a region of relatively high spatial density, i.e., where collisions would be statistically more likely to occur.

Fortunately, the threat will be relatively short-lived with the majority of the debris expected to reenter the atmosphere within one year. The explosion of the Proton Briz-M stage (International Designator 2012-044C, U.S. Satellite Number 38746) occurred on October 16. 2012. The stage, with a dry mass of 2.6 metric tons, had been stranded in an elliptical orbit of about 265 km by 5015 km with an estimated 10 metric tons of propellant, following a launch malfunction on 6 August. The massive fragmentation occurred at an altitude of 290 km as the stage approached perigee. Although as many as 700 large debris were detected by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN), only 111 had been officially cataloged by the end of December 2012. The number of debris potentially hazardous to operational spacecraft was estimated to be much more numerous. To ascertain the population of small debris from the Briz-M breakup, the Orbital Debris Program Office requested special observations of the debris cloud by the Haystack Auxiliary radar operated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Lincoln Laboratory and by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Goldstone radars in California. These radars can detect centimeter- and millimeter-class objects at the Briz-M debris perigee altitudes. The observations did indicate a much larger debris population than could be tracked by the SSN. Technical assessments found the risk to the ISS from the Briz-M debris to be a small fraction of the risk from the normal background debris environment.

Publicly available sources suggest a dry mass on the order of 1100 kg. Stored energy sources may include stored chemical energy in batteries and residual liquid bipropellants. Currently, the spacecraft remains oscillating in the east geopotential well centered around 75 deg East longitude with a period of approximately 2.73 years. Small velocity changes are sufficient for resident objects to leave the well, suggesting that any debris created in this event may leave the well and eventually propagate throughout the GEO region. A relatively significant amount of propellant may have remained onboard following GEO insertion due to this spacecraft\u0027s relatively short operational career of less than 1.4 years. The DFH-3 490 N liquid apogee engine is the Shanghai Institute of Space Propulsion FY-25 hypergolic bipropellant engine using monomethylhydrazine as the fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer. The smaller reaction control thrusters employ these hypergolic propellants in a unified propulsion system but the actual equipment fit and propellant storage configuration is unknown at this time.

Slight changes in the orientation and the orbit of the satellite were also measured at the same time. Following a preliminary investigation, the operations team at ESA\u0027s operations centre ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany suspected a possible impact by space debris or micrometeoroid on the solar wing. Detailed analyses of the satellite\u0027s status were performed to understand the cause of this power loss. In addition, it was decided to activate the on-board cameras to acquire pictures of the array. These cameras were originally carried to monitor the deployment of the solar wings, which occurred just a few hours after launch in April 2014, and were not intended to be used afterwards. Following their switch-on, one camera provided a picture that clearly showed the strike on the solar panel. The power reduction is relatively small compared to the overall power generated by the solar wing, which remains much higher than what the satellite requires for routine operations. Assuming the change in attitude and the orbit of the satellite at impact, the typical speed of such a fragment, plus additional parameters, the first estimates indicate that the size of the particle was of a few millimetres.Analysis continues to obtain indications on whether the origin of the object was natural or man-made. The pictures of the affected area show a diameter of roughly 40 cm created on the solar array structure, confirming an impact from the back side, as suggested by the satellite\u0027s attitude rate readings.

While the Transtage with its load of test satellites was successfully placed into a temporary 169-kilometer parking orbit, the oxidizer valve on the Transtage\u0027s attitude control system became stuck open possibly as a result of contamination in the system. Despite the leak, the Transtage completed its second of three planned burns to place itself and payload into a 185 km x 33800 km equatorial transfer orbit. Unfortunately, during the long coast before the final ignition of the Transtage, its attitude control system oxidizer supply was exhausted bringing the mission to a premature conclusion. Ground controllers were able to deploy the three communications satellites which were then able to fulfill many of their original objectives despite being placed into an incorrect orbit.

Due to the nature of these orbits, which result in high altitudes over the Northern Hemisphere where most surveillance sensors are located, debris detection and tracking is extremely difficult. Only the largest fragments can be seen. Cosmos 862 class spacecraft were equipped with self-destruct packages in the event that spacecraft control was lost; this was the cause of breakups until the explosives were removed after Cosmos 1481. Podvig reported an estimate end of life for Cosmos 1348 as 22 July 1984. If correct, this could imply a breakup mechanism different that other members of the Cosmos 862 class. An examination of the mean motion history of Cosmos 1348 indicated, however, that it was under active control until the event date of 2 September 1984, implying that the cause attributed to the fragmentation of other class members was similarly responsible for this spacecraft\\u2019s fragmentation.","eventType":"Cosmos 862 Class (Explosive Charge)","objects":[{"cosparId":"1982-029A","vimpelId":null,"satno":13124,"shape":"Irr \u002B 6 Pan","mass":1238.85,"length":4.2,"height":1.6,"depth":4.2,"xSectMax":20.0371255423526,"xSectMin":6.72,"xSectAvg":15.54,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-1348","id":"13121"}],"name":"","id":"449"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2005-02-17T00:00:00","comment":"Another DMSP event?","eventType":"DMSP/NOAA Class","objects":[{"cosparId":"2003-048A","vimpelId":null,"satno":28054,"shape":"Box \u002B 1 Pan","mass":1503,"length":4.4,"height":1.2,"depth":6.6,"xSectMax":9.71676656563309,"xSectMin":1.44,"xSectAvg":6.71453333333333,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"DMSP 5D-3 F-16 (USA 172)","id":"28051"}],"name":"","id":"450"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-06-14T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1971-035A","vimpelId":null,"satno":5174,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":743.31,"length":2,"height":3,"depth":3,"xSectMax":6.77271026997976,"xSectMin":3.14159265358979,"xSectAvg":6.28318530717959,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-407","id":"5173"}],"name":"","id":"844"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1999-05-05T00:00:00","comment":"Following the LEO insertion, the rocket entered a coast phase, before the second stage restarted for what was planned to be a 162 second burn to insert Orion 3 into a geosynchronous transfer orbit.

It was the second failure of an RL-10 powered rocket in less than a week, after the Centaur upper stage of a Titan IV rocket failed during the launch of USA-143 on 30 April, although this incident was later attributed to a programming error. An investigation later determined that the failure of Orion 3\u0027s launch was due to the wall of the RL-10 combustion chamber being breached. The investigation found that it was likely that the breach in the chamber was along one of the seams where the chamber had been soldered.

These motors have a long history of fragmentations, this event being the 47th breakup of this class of object over its program history and the first since July 2016. A total of 380 SL-12 auxiliary motors have been cataloged between 1970 and 2012. Ullage motors, used to provide three-axis control to the Block DM during coast and to settle propellants prior to an engine restart, are routinely ejected after the Block DM stage ignites for the final time. This SOZ unit (International Designator 2010-041G, U.S. Strategic Command [USSTRATCOM] Space Surveillance Network [SSN] catalog number 37143) is associated with the launch of the Cosmos 2464-2466 spacecraft, members of the Russian global positioning navigation system (GLONASS) constellation. The unit fragmented into multiple pieces, though none have entered the SSN catalog as of 5 October 2017. The motor was in a highly elliptical 18684 x 756 km orbit at an inclination of 65.2 deg at the time of the breakup. Due to difficulties in tracking objects in deep space elliptical orbits, this event may have produced many fragmentation debris. Interestingly, this is the second SOZ unit whose fragmentation was predicted by analysts of the Air Force Space Command 18th Space Control Squadron. Their analysis indicates that SOZ units experience outgassing prior to the fragmentation event; the main body of the SOZ can then exhibit the effects of outgassing for several days after the event. This new analytical technique is useful in prompting additional surveillance of a SOZ unit prior to and postfragmentation and assessing event time for modeling and risk assessment purposes.","eventType":"Proton Ullage Motor","objects":[{"cosparId":"2010-041G","vimpelId":null,"satno":37143,"shape":"Cyl","mass":56,"length":0.6,"height":1.1,"depth":1.1,"xSectMax":0.718013785138436,"xSectMin":0.282743338823081,"xSectAvg":0.659734457253857,"objectClass":"Rocket Mission Related Object","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Proton-M/DM-2 ullage motor (SOZ)","id":"37140"}],"name":"","id":"519"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-05-29T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1971-050A","vimpelId":null,"satno":5253,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":862.24,"length":1.2,"height":5.1,"depth":5.1,"xSectMax":6.22362440466816,"xSectMin":1.13097335529233,"xSectAvg":5.37212343763855,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-425","id":"5252"}],"name":"","id":"845"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1970-09-01T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1970-064A","vimpelId":null,"satno":4497,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":891.97,"length":1.4,"height":1.4,"depth":1.4,"xSectMax":2.49224637961449,"xSectMin":1.539380400259,"xSectAvg":2.3090706003885,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-358","id":"4497"}],"name":"","id":"846"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-01-03T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1970-102A","vimpelId":null,"satno":4783,"shape":"Cyl","mass":693.76,"length":2,"height":3,"depth":3,"xSectMax":6.77271026997976,"xSectMin":3.14159265358979,"xSectAvg":6.28318530717959,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-381","id":"4783"}],"name":"","id":"847"},{"altitude":1460,"latitude":-39.2,"longitude":226.8,"epoch":"1973-11-15T00:00:00","comment":"Air Force Space Command analysts have disclosed the discovery of the earliest Delta second stage rocket body to have fragmented on-orbit. The Delta model N rocket body launched the ESSA 8 (TOS-F) spacecraft. The rocket body is assessed to have fragmented on 15 November 1973 after having been on-orbit 4.9 years and was in a 1462 x 1413 km altitude, 101.6 degrees inclination orbit at the time of the event. Potential stored energy sources include batteries, a cold gas attitude control system, propellant pressurization gas, and residual hypergolic propellants. In addition to the parent body, 17 additional fragments have entered the public satellite catalog as of 4 June 2017. This event supersedes the fragmentation of the NOAA 3 Delta second-stage rocket body (International Designator 1973-086B) as being the first Delta to fragment - by approximately 43 days. This launch, also known as \\\u0022Delta 62\\\u0022, occurred well before the introduction of now standard mitigation practices inaugurated, on an informal basis, by Delta 155 in August 1981. However, an assessment of Delta rocket bodies remaining on-orbit prior to the introduction of informal or formal passivation practices (ODQN, vol. 6, issue 3, July 2001, pp. 7-8, \\\u0022A Fragmentation Assessment of Legacy Delta Rocket Bodies\\\u0022) had noted that the five Delta model N second stages had exhibited no signs of fragmentation events at the time of writing. From that article, revised slightly for clarification: \\\u0022Several changes differentiate an N model second stage from the 100 (and later) series. Physically, the model N and 100 series were stressed for aerodynamic flight, while the 1000 series introduced the so-called \\\u0022straight 8\\\u0022 configuration,i.e., a constant eight (8) foot diameter interstage structure that suspended the second stage inside the structure. The most obvious visual distinction is the series 1000\u0027s annular truss encircling the second stage. Less obvious was a change in motor from the N model\u0027s Aerojet AJ10-118 (Vanguard rocket body heritage) to the 100 series\u0027 AJ10-118F (Titan Transtage heritage). An examination of all AJ10-118 powered Delta second stages to attain orbit indicates there are no fragmentation or anomalous events associated with any rocket body. Therefore, unvented N model second stages appear to present no fragmentation threat.\\\u0022 With the long-delayed recognition of analyst element sets being associated with Delta 62, this conclusion is refuted.","eventType":"Delta Upper Stage","objects":[{"cosparId":"1968-114B","vimpelId":null,"satno":3616,"shape":"Cyl","mass":778,"length":1.4,"height":5.2,"depth":5.2,"xSectMax":7.44097386211654,"xSectMin":1.539380400259,"xSectAvg":6.48738882966292,"objectClass":"Rocket Body","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Delta E (Delta N)","id":"3616"}],"name":"","id":"525"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2017-08-25T00:00:00","comment":"Ground-based observations of PT Telkom\u0027s 18-year old Telkom-1 satellite show a large cloud of debris generated on August 25, 2017.

In addition, a small gaseous nitrogen (GN2) thruster system and batteries compose the on-board stored energy complement, which could potentially contribute to an energetic fragmentation event.","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1998-046E","vimpelId":null,"satno":25417,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":42,"length":1.04,"height":0.2,"depth":4.3,"xSectMax":2.1062,"xSectMin":0.425,"xSectAvg":1.4836731617647,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Orbcomm FM16","id":"25413"}],"name":"","id":"649"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2019-03-27T00:00:00","comment":"The Indian spacecraft Microsat-R, launched on 24 January 2019, was intentionally destroyed in a test of a ground-based, direct-ascent Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon system at 05:42 GMT on 27 March 2019.

The detection was made via data collected  by the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) Space Surveillance Network (SSN). The parent object of the breakup was an H-2A upper stage half-cylindrical fairing cover associated with the GOSAT-2 mission, which was launched on 29 October 2018. The orbit of 2018-084C at the time of breakup was 643 km x 595 km, with an inclination of 97.89 degrees. Based on 18SPCS\u0027 data and analysis, the GOSAT-2 mission released three mission-related debris during deployment of the payloads. They included the fairing adapter and two identical cylindrical fairing halves. Another small fragment (2018-084A,  SSN#  43671) was also detected, but it rapidly decayed and reentered in August 2019. The fairing cover\u0027s mass is estimated to be more than 100 kg. It is made of aluminum alloy honeycomb with carbon fiber reinforced plastic skin. A total of 74 additional fragments from the breakup of 2018-084C had been cataloged by early October. Nine of them decayed and reentered in  less than three months after the event. The 18SPCS conducted a detailed data analysis to screen all tracked objects near 2018-084C around the time of the breakup but could not identify any candidate for a likely collision with 2018-084C. Since the fairing cover did not appear to contain any energy sources, explosion was out of the question.

Initially detected by the image processing system as a change of satellite state, the orbit change event included a decrease in spin rate, a change in attitude, some nutation, a temperature change on thrusters and fuel lines, and a small drop in solar array power. After intensive investigations with the support of Thales Alenia Space and ESA/ESTEC, it seems that damage has been sustained in the area of one of the radial thruster pairs. The hypothesis that Meteosat-8 has suffered a collision with an object crossing the geostationary orbit and/or lost some mass remains the most likely one. Collision with either a micro-meteoroid or space debris appears a possible cause of this damage, according to EUMETSAT. Less likely is loss of mass from the spacecraft, as no further spacecraft anomalies have been revealed by testing so far. Investigations have revealed that the unified propulsion sub-system, the thermal control sub-system and to a lesser extent the electrical power sub-system have been affected by this incident. In particular, one of the nominal thrusters used for East-West station keeping manoeuvres seems affected, possibly damaged. The redundant thruster for the same function has been tested and seems to be performing well. The external surface of the satellite has been damaged and some internal parts of the satellite are now exposed both to cold space and Sun illumination as the satellite spins. This has caused a new thermal equilibrium to be reached inside the satellite, which means that a new thermal configuration will be required to minimise the impact on the satellite and to allow safe operation during eclipse. The imaging system appears not to have been affected by the incident. As the redundant branch of thrusters can be safely used, and as a new thermal configuration can be developed, there should be no impact on Meteosat-8\u0027s ability to serve as the in-orbit backup satellite, and to provide the Rapid Scanning service, EUMETSAT said. However, a level of redundancy has been lost which could have a longer-term impact on Meteosat-8\u0027s availability. The satellite, built by a European consortium led by Thales Alenia Space and launched 2002, was originally expected to stay operational until 2009.","eventType":"Small Impactor","objects":[{"cosparId":"2002-040B","vimpelId":null,"satno":27509,"shape":"Cyl","mass":2010,"length":3.2,"height":2.4,"depth":3.2,"xSectMax":11.1204244254875,"xSectMin":7.68,"xSectAvg":10.0530964914873,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Meteosat 8 (MSG 1)","id":"27506"}],"name":"","id":"748"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2002-04-11T00:00:00","comment":"The satellite reportedly suffered a temporary outage in the early hours of 11 April 2002 for unknown reasons.

CONTOUR\u0027s Thiokol STAR 30 solid-propellant rocket motor, supplied by ATK Tactical Systems Co., was pre-programmed to ignite at 0849 UTC on 15 August 2002 and deliver a 1920 metre-per-second boost which CONTOUR needed to escape Earth\u0027s orbit. A direct launch into deep space had been possible but would have added US$ 10 million to the budget. At about 225 kilometres above the Indian Ocean, the spacecraft was too low for NASA\u0027s Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas to track it at the scheduled time of the 50-second burn. The CONTOUR mission operations team at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) expected to regain contact at approximately 0935 UTC to confirm the burn, but the DSN antennas in California/USA, Australia and Spain did not acquire a signal. Images taken by the Spacewatch 1.8-meter telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona/USA indicated that the space probe probably was damaged or destroyed after the motor burn. A total of three separate parts were detected, moving in an orbit that would have been the result of a burn two or three seconds short. Sources connected with APL noted that infrared observations made by the U.S. military showed a sudden flare of heat, obviously indicating some kind of explosion, two or three seconds before the end of the manoeuvre. An explanation might be that isolated patches of remnant solid fuel broke loose and blocked the motor\u0027s nozzle, resulting in an explosive pressure build-up inside the motor. A second working theory is that there was a systemic failure of the spacecraft that was related to either the acceleration of the solid rocket motor\u0027s firing, or heating that resulted from its operation. NASA\u0027s CONTOUR Mishap Investigation Board identified four possible causes for the failure, the most probable of which is a structural failure of the spacecraft caused by plume heating during the embedded solid-rocket motor burn. In other words, it was a design flaw: the solid-fuel motor was placed too far up the body of the spacecraft, allowing hot exhaust gases to heat the probe and trigger its break-up. However, the lack of telemetry and observational data, immediately prior to and during the burn, and the lack of recoverable debris, leave open the possibility that one of several other problems could have led to the accident. The alternate possible causes are catastrophic failure of the solid rocket motor; collision with space debris or meteoroids; and loss of dynamic control of the spacecraft.","eventType":"Propulsion","objects":[{"cosparId":"2002-034A","vimpelId":null,"satno":27457,"shape":"Oct Cyl","mass":435,"length":2,"height":2,"depth":2,"xSectMax":4.89897948556636,"xSectMin":2.82842712474619,"xSectAvg":4.47568102129381,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Contour","id":"27454"}],"name":"","id":"751"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1968-01-21T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1968-006A","vimpelId":null,"satno":3100,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":434,"length":1.2,"height":5.1,"depth":5.1,"xSectMax":6.22362440466816,"xSectMin":1.13097335529233,"xSectAvg":5.37212343763855,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-200","id":"3100"}],"name":"","id":"836"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-11-30T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1971-102A","vimpelId":null,"satno":5625,"shape":"Cyl","mass":743.31,"length":1.4,"height":1.4,"depth":1.4,"xSectMax":2.49224637961449,"xSectMin":1.539380400259,"xSectAvg":2.3090706003885,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-459","id":"5623"}],"name":"","id":"837"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1980-10-16T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1980-083A","vimpelId":null,"satno":12016,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":867.2,"length":1.2,"height":5.1,"depth":5.1,"xSectMax":6.22362440466816,"xSectMin":1.13097335529233,"xSectAvg":5.37212343763855,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-1215","id":"12013"}],"name":"","id":"838"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1981-01-21T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1981-006A","vimpelId":null,"satno":12149,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 4 Ant","mass":1045,"length":1.8,"height":2.5,"depth":23,"xSectMax":13.9006573247719,"xSectMin":2.54469004940773,"xSectAvg":8.78797009332572,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-1241","id":"12146"}],"name":"","id":"839"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1969-03-07T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1969-021B","vimpelId":null,"satno":3776,"shape":"Cyl","mass":1434,"length":2.4,"height":4.2,"depth":4.2,"xSectMax":11.048620352157,"xSectMin":4.5238934211693,"xSectAvg":10.1787601976309,"objectClass":"Rocket Body","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos 3 second stage (S3) (Cosmos 3M (11K65M))","id":"3776"}],"name":"","id":"840"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1972-07-12T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[{"cosparId":"1972-053A","vimpelId":null,"satno":6097,"shape":"Cyl \u002B 2 Pan","mass":867.2,"length":1.2,"height":5.1,"depth":5.1,"xSectMax":6.22362440466816,"xSectMin":1.13097335529233,"xSectAvg":5.37212343763855,"objectClass":"Payload","reentry":null,"states":null,"destinationOrbits":null,"initialOrbits":null,"operators":null,"launch":null,"name":"Cosmos-500","id":"6095"}],"name":"","id":"841"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2006-03-28T00:00:00","comment":"Ekspress-AM11 failed on 28 March 2006, 2341 UTC as the result of \\\u0022sudden external impact\\\u0022, according to a preliminary analysis by manufacturer NPO-PM.

As of 22 April, 43 fragments from the breakup of YunHai 1-02 have been identified and tracked by the 18 SPCS. On August 15, 2021, 18 SPCS reported that object 1996-051Q (US SSN catalogue number 48078), a small debris object from the Zenit-2 rocket launched in 1996, collided with a satellite. A correlation with the breakup of Yunhai 1-02 has been made by Jonathan McDowell, with 1996-051Q being within 1 km (based on TLE) distance to Yunhai 1-02 at the time the event
