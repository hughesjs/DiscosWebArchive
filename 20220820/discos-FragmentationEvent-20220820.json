One fragment was found in an orbit with a period more than one minute less than that of UARS, whereas the period of another fragment gained two minutes. Initially, a few other debris were thought to have been detected by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network, but they could not be found with follow-up observations. The two lower orbital debris fell back to Earth by the end of November, leaving only two debris remaining in orbit at the end of the year. The cause of UARS\u0027 minor fragmentation is still under investigation. The spacecraft had been purged of all propellants and its batteries had been left in a safed state. Only a slight amount of pressurant is judged to have been a potential energy source at the time of the event. The UARS structure appears to be essentially unchanged with no significant change in its orbital decay rate. One explanation for this anomalous event is a strike by a small, untracked particle, although the exact cause is likely to remain unknown.","eventType":"Anomalous","objects":[],"name":"","id":"196"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2014-04-01T00:00:00","comment":"Cosmos 1867 (International Designator 1987-060A, U.S. Strategic Command [USSTRATCOM] Space Surveillance Network [SSN] catalog number 18187), a Plazma-A-class spacecraft launched by the former Soviet Union to test a new, advanced nuclear power supply, fragmented in April 2014.

According to Russian reports, the nuclear reactors on Cosmos 1818 and Cosmos 1867 functioned for approximately 5 and 11 months, respectively. For the next two decades, the two inactive spacecraft circled the Earth without significant incident. Following the fragmentation event on or about 4 July 2008, the U.S. Space Surveillance Network was able to produce orbital data on 30 small debris (Figure 2). The majority of these debris were ejected in a posigrade direction with velocities of less than 15 meters per second, suggesting a relatively low energy event. From radar detections, a larger number of very small debris appear to have also been released, but routine tracking of these debris has proven difficult. Special observations of a few of the debris revealed characteristics generally indicative of metallic spheres. Cosmos 1818 employed sodiumpotassium (NaK) as a coolant for its reactor, as did the older RORSATs. Much of the NaK within Cosmos 1818 probably was in a solid state at the time of the debris generation event. However, some NaK present in the radiator coolant tubes might have reached a temporary liquid state, particularly when the spacecraft was exposed to direct solar illumination. A breach in a coolant tube (for example, due to long-term thermal stress) at such a time could have resulted in the release of NaK droplets. Alternatively, the hyper-velocity impact of a small particle might have generated sufficient heat to melt some of the NaK, which then would have formed spheres with metallic properties.","eventType":"TOPAZ Leakage Class","objects":[],"name":"","id":"223"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2002-12-24T00:00:00","comment":"The fragment is catalogued object 27637","eventType":"Anomalous","objects":[],"name":"","id":"347"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2014-11-30T00:00:00","comment":"On 30th November 2014, the spacecraft produced four pieces of debris that are currently tracked and catalogued by JSpOC.

It had a repeating ground track every 95 revolutions. It maintained this tightly controlled orbit until mid-April 1988. On 10 April the last orbit correction occurred. After that a steady decay started. Initially it was thought that the spacecraft would descend to the 89.6 minute orbit with a 7-day, 111 revolution, repeating pattern. That altitude was reached on 9 May 1988 and when the spacecraft continued to drop it was obvious that the spacecraft was in trouble. TASS announced on 13 May 1988 that contact with the craft was lost in April, but that there was no danger to the general public because there were \\\u0022systems ensuring radiation safety on completion of the flight\\\u0022. Meanwhile, Kosmos-1932 terminated its mission and safely boosted its reactor to the high orbit, using a back-up system: all through the natural decay of the craft its attitude control seems to have been working well. But then the spacecraft lost stabilization - due to aerodynamic forces or loss of attitude control propellant. Also, electric power must have been generated throughout this long period - and the only available source of power was the reactor. It must have performed reasonably well since it did not trigger the ascent to high orbit. But the loss of attitude control immediately triggered the boost to higher orbit - at 21:08 UT on 30 September 1988, according to TASS. However, the resulting high orbit was somewhat different from normal, possibly caused by an incorrect initial attitude at separation of the ascent vehicle. If the maneuver started at the equator the yaw error could have been as much as 45 degrees causing a lower apogee of the transfer orbit. The final orbit was about 300 km lower than normal; actually between 695.4 km and 763.4 km at 66.1 degree inclination.","eventType":"RORSAT Reactor Core Ejection Class","objects":[],"name":"","id":"575"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1982-11-10T00:00:00","comment":"When Kosmos-1365 was deactivated on 27 September, a replacement for that satellite was promptly launched with Kosmos-1412  (Satno 13600, Int. designator 1982-099A) at 00:00 UT on 2 October 1982.

The first fragmentation event occurred nine years after launch and resulted in 11 new cataloged objects. The second event was detected by D.G. King-Hele of the RAE, and NAVSPASUR confirmed 44 additional fragments. By August 1976 no additional debris had been cataloged but 19 objects were being tracked in orbits with mean motions near 8 and eccentricities between 0.16 and 0.34. Due to the character of PAGEOS and its subsequent debris, natural perturbations had little effect on orbital period but strongly increased eccentricity by simultaneously lowering perigee and raising apogee. About 10 September 1976 one of the 19 unofficial objects is believed to have broken up into perhaps more than 250 new pieces, none of which were cataloged prior to reentry. Eighteen objects were later cataloged during 7-8 October 1976. On the first anniversary of the second fragmentation (20 Jan 1977), 45 fragments were cataloged without elements and immediately decayed administratively. Additional fragmentations are suspected to have taken place in June 1978, September 1984, and December 1985. Historically, radar tracking of PAGEOS debris has been extremely difficult and cross-tagging frequent.

Under a commercial contract, Russia launched the Asiasat 5 spacecraft on 11 August 2009, employing a powerful Proton-M launch vehicle equipped with a Breeze-M (aka Briz-M) final stage. This stage is designed to carry a geosynchronous spacecraft from a low altitude parking orbit into a highly elliptical transfer orbit with two burns. The first burn raises the apogee altitude to nearly 36,000 km, followed by a second burn which typically raises perigee several thousand kilometers or more. Before the second burn is initiated, a large (1.3 metric ton dry mass) propellant tank is ejected. For the Asiasat 5 mission, the Breeze-M tank (International Designator 2009-042C, U.S. Satellite Number 35698) was left in an orbit of 400 km by 35,740 km with an inclination of 49.2 degrees.

The event, which occurred at an altitude of approximately 1370 km, was sufficient to alter the orbit of the spacecraft and to produce a new piece of debris which was large enough to be tracked. Radar returns suggest the fragment diameter was between 20 and 50 cm. Analysts of Air Force Space Command, noticed a new object in the vicinity of Cosmos 539 (1972-102A, U.S. Satellite Number 6319) and calculated that the fragment was ejected from the spacecraft on 21 April at a relative velocity of 19 m/s. The newly created debris was cataloged as U.S. Satellite Number 27423 on 6 May. The causes of these debris-producing events are thought to be related to the degradation of satellite surface materials under the harsh temperature and radiation environment of outer space and to sub-millimeter particle impacts. Also immediately obvious was the high susceptibility of the fragment to solar radiation pressure, demonstrated by rapid and dramatic changes in its orbit. From an initial orbit of about 1365 km by 1445 km with an inclination of 74 degrees, the fragment\\u00e2s perigee began to decrease while its apogee increased. Within four weeks the orbit had been perturbed into one of 750 km by 1895 km. At this point, atmospheric drag became the dominant factor, causing the object to reenter the atmosphere a little more than two weeks later on 3 June. Thus, the fragment existed for only 43 days. At the time of the event the spacecraft was in an orbit of approximately 1340 km by 1380 km. Satellite tracking data indicated that a small but permanent change in the orbit of Cosmos 539 coincided with the creation of the piece of debris. Such an orbital perturbation would be a natural result of a collision with a small object. The orbital period of the spacecraft was reduced by nearly a second.

Both spacecraft were in nearly circular orbits with high inclinations: 86.4 degrees and 74.0 degrees, respectively. At the time of the collision, the two orbital planes intersected at a nearly right angle, resulting in a collision velocity of more than 11 km/s. The two complex spacecraft were of moderate dry mass: 560 kg for Iridium 33 and approximately 900 kg for Cosmos 2251. Although the number of debris tracked by the SSN is high, an even larger amount (~1300) would be expected if the two satellites had hit body-to-body. Due to the differential orbital periods of the debris, their orbital planes will gradually separate and form a shell about the Earth. The debris from the Iridium 33 spacecraft will spread more slowly than those from Cosmos 2251 due to their higher inclination. The Haystack and the Haystack Auxiliary radars observations confirmed a large number of small debris from both spacecraft. The collision of Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 occurred in a region of relatively high spatial density, i.e., where collisions would be statistically more likely to occur.

Cosmos 2313 performed such a maneuver during 22-23 April 1997 and was close to reentry at the time of the event. Earlier spacecraft breakups resulted in up to 150 or more trackable debris. The cause of the event may well not be propellant related, but by reducing the orbital lifetime recent vehicles have decayed before the trigger mechanism could activate. At least 90 debris were detected after this event.","eventType":"Cosmos 699 Class (EORSAT)","objects":[],"name":"","id":"243"},{"altitude":685,"latitude":-38,"longitude":60,"epoch":"1996-07-24T00:00:00","comment":"The incident marked the first time that two objects in the U.S. satellite catalog are known to have accidentally run into one another. The CERISE spacecraft (Satellite Number 23606, International Designator 1995-033B) is a microsatellite of British design. The other participant in the encounter was Satellite Number 18208 (International Designator 1986-019RF) which was generated in November, 1986, when ESA\u0027s SPOT 1 rocket body broke-up into nearly 500 tracked debris. The orbit of this fragmentation debris at the time of the collision was 660 km by 680 km at an inclination of 98.45 degrees. The collision, which occurred with a relative velocity of 14.8 km/s, produced only a single piece of debris large enough to be tracked, i.e., the upper portion of the gravity-gradient boom. Analysis of the manufacturer of the space craft bus, Surrey Satellite Technology Ctd. at the University of Surrey, United Kingdom suggested that the 6 m, gravity-gradient boom had been severed at 3.1-3.2 meter from its base. Using USAF Space Command\u0027s COMBO (Computation of Miss Between Orbits) program, a close approach of less than 1 km between Satellite 23606 and Satellite 18208 was determined by NASA JSC to have taken place at 0948 GMT on 24 July over the southern Indian Ocean. Naval Space Operations Center (NAVSPOC) at Dahlgren, Virginia, replicated the NASA findings and, using direct observational data and special perturbation theory, was able to refine the miss distance uncertainty to within 137 m. In addition, NAVSPOC identified a minor perturbation in the orbit of Satellite 18208 which occurred about the time of the event.","eventType":"Collision","objects":[],"name":"","id":"244"},{"altitude":230,"latitude":58.2,"longitude":157.5,"epoch":"1997-09-16T00:00:00","comment":"Cosmos 2343 was the sixth of the Cosmos 2031 class of spacecraft which debuted in 1989 but was not flown since 1993.

A report available to the public summarizes JAXA\u0027s findings: An unexpected behaviour \\nof the Attitude Control System (ACS) indicated to the spacecraft that it was rotating, although it was not. On-board reaction wheels were activated to stop the rotation, which induced an \\nactual rotation of the spacecraft. The ACS assessed the spacecraft to be in a critical situation and attempted to use the RCS to enter a Safe-Hold mode. Unfortunately, incorrect thruster \\ncontrol parameters led to the thrusters increasing the angular acceleration of the spacecraft. As rotational speed exceeded design parameters, several major components separated from the \\nspacecraft, leading to mission loss. JAXA post mortem analyses suggest that the Solar Array Paddles, the Extensible Optical Bench, and other components separated near the spacecraft body.

These motors have a long history of fragmentations, this event being the 47th breakup of this class of object over its program history and the first since July 2016. A total of 380 SL-12 auxiliary motors have been cataloged between 1970 and 2012. Ullage motors, used to provide three-axis control to the Block DM during coast and to settle propellants prior to an engine restart, are routinely ejected after the Block DM stage ignites for the final time. This SOZ unit (International Designator 2010-041G, U.S. Strategic Command [USSTRATCOM] Space Surveillance Network [SSN] catalog number 37143) is associated with the launch of the Cosmos 2464-2466 spacecraft, members of the Russian global positioning navigation system (GLONASS) constellation. The unit fragmented into multiple pieces, though none have entered the SSN catalog as of 5 October 2017. The motor was in a highly elliptical 18684 x 756 km orbit at an inclination of 65.2 deg at the time of the breakup. Due to difficulties in tracking objects in deep space elliptical orbits, this event may have produced many fragmentation debris. Interestingly, this is the second SOZ unit whose fragmentation was predicted by analysts of the Air Force Space Command 18th Space Control Squadron. Their analysis indicates that SOZ units experience outgassing prior to the fragmentation event; the main body of the SOZ can then exhibit the effects of outgassing for several days after the event. This new analytical technique is useful in prompting additional surveillance of a SOZ unit prior to and postfragmentation and assessing event time for modeling and risk assessment purposes.","eventType":"Proton Ullage Motor","objects":[],"name":"","id":"519"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-05-29T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"845"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1970-09-01T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"846"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-01-03T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"847"},{"altitude":1460,"latitude":-39.2,"longitude":226.8,"epoch":"1973-11-15T00:00:00","comment":"Air Force Space Command analysts have disclosed the discovery of the earliest Delta second stage rocket body to have fragmented on-orbit. The Delta model N rocket body launched the ESSA 8 (TOS-F) spacecraft. The rocket body is assessed to have fragmented on 15 November 1973 after having been on-orbit 4.9 years and was in a 1462 x 1413 km altitude, 101.6 degrees inclination orbit at the time of the event. Potential stored energy sources include batteries, a cold gas attitude control system, propellant pressurization gas, and residual hypergolic propellants. In addition to the parent body, 17 additional fragments have entered the public satellite catalog as of 4 June 2017. This event supersedes the fragmentation of the NOAA 3 Delta second-stage rocket body (International Designator 1973-086B) as being the first Delta to fragment - by approximately 43 days. This launch, also known as \\\u0022Delta 62\\\u0022, occurred well before the introduction of now standard mitigation practices inaugurated, on an informal basis, by Delta 155 in August 1981. However, an assessment of Delta rocket bodies remaining on-orbit prior to the introduction of informal or formal passivation practices (ODQN, vol. 6, issue 3, July 2001, pp. 7-8, \\\u0022A Fragmentation Assessment of Legacy Delta Rocket Bodies\\\u0022) had noted that the five Delta model N second stages had exhibited no signs of fragmentation events at the time of writing. From that article, revised slightly for clarification: \\\u0022Several changes differentiate an N model second stage from the 100 (and later) series. Physically, the model N and 100 series were stressed for aerodynamic flight, while the 1000 series introduced the so-called \\\u0022straight 8\\\u0022 configuration,i.e., a constant eight (8) foot diameter interstage structure that suspended the second stage inside the structure. The most obvious visual distinction is the series 1000\u0027s annular truss encircling the second stage. Less obvious was a change in motor from the N model\u0027s Aerojet AJ10-118 (Vanguard rocket body heritage) to the 100 series\u0027 AJ10-118F (Titan Transtage heritage). An examination of all AJ10-118 powered Delta second stages to attain orbit indicates there are no fragmentation or anomalous events associated with any rocket body. Therefore, unvented N model second stages appear to present no fragmentation threat.\\\u0022 With the long-delayed recognition of analyst element sets being associated with Delta 62, this conclusion is refuted.","eventType":"Delta Upper Stage","objects":[],"name":"","id":"525"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2017-08-25T00:00:00","comment":"Ground-based observations of PT Telkom\u0027s 18-year old Telkom-1 satellite show a large cloud of debris generated on August 25, 2017.

The detection was made via data collected  by the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) Space Surveillance Network (SSN). The parent object of the breakup was an H-2A upper stage half-cylindrical fairing cover associated with the GOSAT-2 mission, which was launched on 29 October 2018. The orbit of 2018-084C at the time of breakup was 643 km x 595 km, with an inclination of 97.89 degrees. Based on 18SPCS\u0027 data and analysis, the GOSAT-2 mission released three mission-related debris during deployment of the payloads. They included the fairing adapter and two identical cylindrical fairing halves. Another small fragment (2018-084A,  SSN#  43671) was also detected, but it rapidly decayed and reentered in August 2019. The fairing cover\u0027s mass is estimated to be more than 100 kg. It is made of aluminum alloy honeycomb with carbon fiber reinforced plastic skin. A total of 74 additional fragments from the breakup of 2018-084C had been cataloged by early October. Nine of them decayed and reentered in  less than three months after the event. The 18SPCS conducted a detailed data analysis to screen all tracked objects near 2018-084C around the time of the breakup but could not identify any candidate for a likely collision with 2018-084C.

Initially detected by the image processing system as a change of satellite state, the orbit change event included a decrease in spin rate, a change in attitude, some nutation, a temperature change on thrusters and fuel lines, and a small drop in solar array power. After intensive investigations with the support of Thales Alenia Space and ESA/ESTEC, it seems that damage has been sustained in the area of one of the radial thruster pairs. The hypothesis that Meteosat-8 has suffered a collision with an object crossing the geostationary orbit and/or lost some mass remains the most likely one. Collision with either a micro-meteoroid or space debris appears a possible cause of this damage, according to EUMETSAT. Less likely is loss of mass from the spacecraft, as no further spacecraft anomalies have been revealed by testing so far. Investigations have revealed that the unified propulsion sub-system, the thermal control sub-system and to a lesser extent the electrical power sub-system have been affected by this incident. In particular, one of the nominal thrusters used for East-West station keeping manoeuvres seems affected, possibly damaged. The redundant thruster for the same function has been tested and seems to be performing well. The external surface of the satellite has been damaged and some internal parts of the satellite are now exposed both to cold space and Sun illumination as the satellite spins. This has caused a new thermal equilibrium to be reached inside the satellite, which means that a new thermal configuration will be required to minimise the impact on the satellite and to allow safe operation during eclipse. The imaging system appears not to have been affected by the incident. As the redundant branch of thrusters can be safely used, and as a new thermal configuration can be developed, there should be no impact on Meteosat-8\u0027s ability to serve as the in-orbit backup satellite, and to provide the Rapid Scanning service, EUMETSAT said. However, a level of redundancy has been lost which could have a longer-term impact on Meteosat-8\u0027s availability.

CONTOUR\u0027s Thiokol STAR 30 solid-propellant rocket motor, supplied by ATK Tactical Systems Co., was pre-programmed to ignite at 0849 UTC on 15 August 2002 and deliver a 1920 metre-per-second boost which CONTOUR needed to escape Earth\u0027s orbit. A direct launch into deep space had been possible but would have added US$ 10 million to the budget. At about 225 kilometres above the Indian Ocean, the spacecraft was too low for NASA\u0027s Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas to track it at the scheduled time of the 50-second burn. The CONTOUR mission operations team at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) expected to regain contact at approximately 0935 UTC to confirm the burn, but the DSN antennas in California/USA, Australia and Spain did not acquire a signal. Images taken by the Spacewatch 1.8-meter telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona/USA indicated that the space probe probably was damaged or destroyed after the motor burn. A total of three separate parts were detected, moving in an orbit that would have been the result of a burn two or three seconds short. Sources connected with APL noted that infrared observations made by the U.S. military showed a sudden flare of heat, obviously indicating some kind of explosion, two or three seconds before the end of the manoeuvre. An explanation might be that isolated patches of remnant solid fuel broke loose and blocked the motor\u0027s nozzle, resulting in an explosive pressure build-up inside the motor. A second working theory is that there was a systemic failure of the spacecraft that was related to either the acceleration of the solid rocket motor\u0027s firing, or heating that resulted from its operation. NASA\u0027s CONTOUR Mishap Investigation Board identified four possible causes for the failure, the most probable of which is a structural failure of the spacecraft caused by plume heating during the embedded solid-rocket motor burn. In other words, it was a design flaw: the solid-fuel motor was placed too far up the body of the spacecraft, allowing hot exhaust gases to heat the probe and trigger its break-up. However, the lack of telemetry and observational data, immediately prior to and during the burn, and the lack of recoverable debris, leave open the possibility that one of several other problems could have led to the accident. The alternate possible causes are catastrophic failure of the solid rocket motor; collision with space debris or meteoroids; and loss of dynamic control of the spacecraft.","eventType":"Propulsion","objects":[],"name":"","id":"751"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1968-01-21T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"836"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-11-30T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"837"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1980-10-16T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"838"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1981-01-21T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"839"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1969-03-07T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"840"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1972-07-12T00:00:00","comment":"Spurious event from DISCOS analysis 2021","eventType":"Unknown","objects":[],"name":"","id":"841"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2006-03-28T00:00:00","comment":"Ekspress-AM11 failed on 28 March 2006, 2341 UTC as the result of \\\u0022sudden external impact\\\u0022, according to a preliminary analysis by manufacturer NPO-PM.

breakup of COSMOS-1408 (INTLDES 1982-092A, SCC 13552). Data indicates the breakup occurred on NOV 15, 2021. As of 1720 UTC, NOV 15, 2021, 18 SPCS estimates that there are at least 1,500 associated pieces, all of which are being incorporated into routine conjunction assessment to support spaceflight safety. At this time, there is no additional data available on this event if you log into the website.","eventType":"ASAT","objects":[],"name":"","id":"861"},{"altitude":740,"latitude":-22,"longitude":108,"epoch":"1965-10-15T00:00:00","comment":"This was the second test of the Titan 3C-4 Transtage with AJ10-138 engine using hypergolic propellants. Event occurred one-half revolution after launch following second ignition that may have been accompanied with vehicle tumbling. LCS 2 payload was to have been deployed at 735 km circular while OV2-1 was to have been released later in an orbit of 735 km by about 7400 km. Transtage also malfunctioned on next mission in December 1965. The main remnant of the rocket body was recently identified as Satellite No. 1822 (1965-082DM).","eventType":"Propulsion","objects":[],"name":"","id":"864"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1981-03-08T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"865"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1987-10-03T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"866"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1987-03-13T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"867"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1983-11-05T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"868"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1999-09-14T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"869"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1994-02-14T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"870"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1996-01-13T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"871"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1997-10-12T00:00:00","comment":"Unconfirmed event for MASTER population","eventType":"Unconfirmed","objects":[],"name":"","id":"872"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"1971-02-01T00:00:00","comment":"Delta-1 breakup","eventType":"Propulsion","objects":[],"name":"","id":"874"},{"altitude":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"epoch":"2021-10-24T00:00:00","comment":"This breakup resulted in 21 catalogued fragments (as of Jan 2021) in an altitude of about 1150 km x 1500 km.
